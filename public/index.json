We specialise in cutting-edge and disruptive technologies in education. We enjoy experimenting with emerging technologies as well as research and design methodologies, and exploring how these can transform educational research and practice.\nOur core values centre on democratising the use of technology in education and designing solutions that solve real problems and add meaningful value. As an applied university, we’re passionate about making sure our research outputs have practical applications and genuinely improve educational practice.\nWe work across a wide range of areas, including intelligent tutoring systems (ITS), educational data mining, learning analytics, exploratory learning environments, authoring tools, automated assessment, interoperability of learning technologies, instructional design methodologies, educational games, human-computer interaction, learning platform architectures, user modelling, programming language design in education, and emerging technologies like VR, AR, 3D scanning/printing, and educational robotics.\nWe value experimentation, open inquiry, and translating insights into meaningful practice.\nIf you’re interested in collaborating, feel free to contact me.\n","permalink":"https://skarkalas.github.io/research/education-and-ai/","summary":"\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\r\n  \u003cimg src=\"/img/education_and_ai.jpg\" alt=\"Education and AI\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" /\u003e\r\n  \u003cp style=\"font-size: 0.8em;\"\u003e\r\n    \u003ca href=\"https://www.vecteezy.com/free-photos/robot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eRobot Stock photos by Vecteezy\u003c/a\u003e\r\n  \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003ch2 id=\"about-the-group\"\u003eAbout the Group\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEducation and AI\u003c/strong\u003e is a research group I lead at the University of Derby.
