  <h3>Exten(DT)2</h3>
  <p>
    I'm currently involved in a large EU-funded project (started in September 2022) that investigates how design thinking in relation to emerging technologies can play a transformative role in pedagogical innovation. The consortium comprises partners from Greece, UK, Belgium, Sweden, Norway and Ireland. I'm leading the design and implementation of a platform that enables dynamic scenario building through interoperable educational tools enhanced with intelligent support.

    Iâ€™m also contributing to another EU-funded initiative (started in January 2023) focused on educational transformation with technologies such as AI, VR, AR, and 3D printing. The consortium includes partners from Greece, UK, Italy, Czechia, and the Netherlands. My research explores hybrid interdisciplinary methods to fuse custom educational tools with emerging tech and evaluate their impact through learning analytics.
