I’ve been working at the intersection of industry and education since 1991. My academic journey has taken me through economics, business administration, computer science, and pedagogy - a mix that reflects my passion for both people and technology.

Over the years, I’ve worn many hats: researcher, lecturer, software architect, and CIO. I’ve worked across Europe in Universities and large multinational companies, leading teams and developing prototypes in R&D departments. In academia, I’ve taught a multitude of programming languages, as well as web and database technologies. I’m currently a Senior Lecturer in Software Engineering at the University of Derby (UK), where I also lead the Education and AI research group.

I’ve been fortunate to contribute to a number of exciting projects in educational technology, particularly in areas like learning analytics, educational data mining, and intelligent exploratory learning environments. My work at the UCL Knowledge Lab and my collaborations with City and Birkbeck Universities in London have deeply shaped my thinking in this space. In 2015, I was honoured with the Best Doctoral Research Award by INSTICC.

Outside of teaching and research, I hold certifications in enterprise architecture (TOGAF), project management (BCS), and higher education teaching (HEA). I’m also a member of several professional bodies including the British Computing Society, the Higher Education Academy, and the Association of Enterprise Architects.

At heart, I’m always curious - about how people learn, how systems can be better designed, and how technology can support meaningful change.
